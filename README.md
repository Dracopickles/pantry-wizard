KEY TASKS:

1. Create a front-end interface. This site should be mobile-friendly.
- Way for users to enter the ingredients they have (up to 10)
- A way to indicate tags like 'vegetarian,' 'kosher', or allergies
- A place to display results
- possibly a log-in so users can save their preferences & tags

2. Access the recipe API
- find an API that does what we need
- figure out how to parse the information
- write some functions that get results from API based on the user's needs

3. Handle user input
- is every ingredient a real item?
- if it isn't, can we offer them a guess?
- if there's a weird allergy, can we make sure to check synonyms and friends (egg/eggs, legumes/beans, etc)
- get/store all user input as variables and hand them to API team
